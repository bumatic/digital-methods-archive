This directory stores Telegram session data. This contains information that,
combined with with API ID and API hash (which are stored elsewhere, as
temporary dataset metadata), can be used to interact with the Telegram API.

This is stored persistently so users do not need to authenticate with a
security code for each Telegram query, which is annoying and easily triggers
rate limiting.

TL;DR You can ignore this directory.
