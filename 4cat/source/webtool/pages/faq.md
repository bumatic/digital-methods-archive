### Where do the word lists used in token filtering come from?

The following word lists are available via 4CAT:

- The English stopword list from the [Terrier](http://terrier.org) package.
- The [cracklib](https://github.com/cracklib/cracklib) word list. This is the
  most expansive word list available in 4CAT (English).
- The [Infochimps](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/) English wordlist
  (`words.txt`, English).
- The [OpenTaal](https://www.opentaal.org) wordlist (Dutch).
- A word list of unknown origin that is far more expansive than the OpenTaal
  list, with the trade-off that its provenance is unclear (Dutch).
