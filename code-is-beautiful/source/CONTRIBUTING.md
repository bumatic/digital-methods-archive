## Contributor Licence Agreement

We are asking all past and future contributors to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). Every contributor of non-trivial amounts of code (more than just a line or two) is required to sign a CLA. If somebody is unable to sign the CLA, the contribution (e.g., code, documentation, translations) has unfortunately to be removed from the code-is-beautiful repository.

The CLA ensures that we have a clear licensing for all contributions, which in turn lets us guarantee to users that we have no "stray" intellectual property or differently-licensed material.

**Where do I sign? What's next?**

1. Download a copy of the CLA:

    * [Individual Contributor License Agreement (PDF)](https://github.com/quantifiedcode/code-is-beautiful/raw/master/icla.pdf): If you're working on code-is-beautiful as an individual, this is the form you should use.
    * [Entity Contributor License Agreement (PDF)](https://github.com/quantifiedcode/code-is-beautiful/raw/master/ecla.pdf): If you're working on code-is-beautiful as part of your job, you and your employer will need to download and sign this form.

2. Print out the CLA and sign it.

3. Send the CLA to QuantifiedCode by scanning and emailing the document to [info@quantifiedcode.com](info@quantifiedcode.com)
