# Welcome to "Code-is-beautiful"

## About
Code-is-beautiful is a cross-language project, aimed to collect and develop better ways to visualize source code.

## Who we are

Weâ€™re [QuantifiedCode](https://www.quantifiedcode.com), a Berlin-based startup. Our mission is to help programmers write better code! Therefore, we make state-of-the-art code analysis available to everyone. Our first product is an [online tool for automated, data-driven code review](https://www.quantifiedcode.com), that uses these visuals, to help you better understand your code base. When building this tool we learned a lot about code, code quality and code visualization. With this project we like to share our learnings back to the community and hope, with your support, to take code visualization to the next level.
